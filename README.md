Mirage
======

Mirage is the name of a student project at the end of my third year in ENSAV La Cambre.

The aim of the project is to create a special issue of an existing magasine, build the concept around the editorial line of the existing publication and create both a printed and web version of the same content.

I use NewStatesman as a basis to create Mirage, with which I imagined a declutch from it's regular reportings to talk about utopias in real political mindframes.

Testing if the command line tools will let me configure this git as I want it to be?

This repo is to try my hand at building a website using versionning to document the build.
